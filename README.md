DISCLAIMER: 
This program uses Natural Language Processing and random choice to produce the subject and the body of its tweets. Depending on the subject matter there is a possibility that the algorithm may generate a tweet that could be perceived as vulgar or offensive.  This is not its designed purpose, and I take no responsibility for it.
